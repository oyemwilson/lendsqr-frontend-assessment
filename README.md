# Lendsqr Frontend Assessment

This project is a high-fidelity frontend implementation of the Lendsqr Admin Dashboard. 
It demonstrates a professional approach to building scalable web applications using React, TypeScript, and modern frontend best practices.

## 🧠 Key Implementation Decisions

* **Custom Data Hook:** Developed a `useUsers` hook to centralize fetching, filtering, and pagination logic, keeping UI components clean.
* **Performance:** Implemented client-side filtering with memoization to ensure smooth interaction even as the user list grows.
* **Responsive Design:** Utilized SCSS media queries and flexbox/grid for a mobile-first approach, including a collapsible sidebar.
* **Type Safety:** Every data object (User, Organization, etc.) is strictly typed to prevent runtime errors and improve developer experience.

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

The application uses **Vitest** and **React Testing Library** to ensure reliability:

* **Logic:** Tests for filtering and pagination utilities.
* **UI:** Verification of component rendering and user interaction flows.
* **API:** Mocking data responses to test state transitions.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges & Resolutions

* **Cross-Platform Case Sensitivity:** Encountered import errors during the Linux-based build process on Render. Resolved by enforcing a strict kebab-case naming convention for all files.
* **Bundle Size Optimization:** Analyzed build reports to manage large mock datasets; implemented code-splitting for non-critical routes to optimize initial load time.
* **Sass Migration:** Proactively restructured the style architecture to be compatible with modern `@use` and `@forward` modules for future-proofing.
* **Data Persistence:** As this is a frontend-only task, changes to user data are handled via state and are not persisted to a database.
